Hi Marianna,

The users which have the rights to login are users with a NH_Level > 2. 
Although this could be changed upward. 

NH_Level = 1 is for Guest users (Non Resellers).
NH_Level = 2 is for Resellers.

We may need to add new categories for non-IEDR staff in future.  e.g.
Registrars etc (a new category for Resellers who may sign contracts with
the Registry.)

Could you design it so that the user privileges for CRS are as
configurable as possible?  That is to say, it would be very helpful if
it the CRS privileges are very granular.  We welcome any suggestions you
may have in this regard.

Many thanks

Billy
