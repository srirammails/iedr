Hi Piotr,

Apologies! I did not know it was in such a mess!!!! :(

Yes.  The other 2 tables are the by-product of a data clean-up effort my
colleague Robin Spiteri undertook recently.  I mentioned this to
Patrycja.  So, because he cleaned up the data in the faxlog table
recently, we thought it would be helpful to give you this new "clean"
(not perfect ;) ) data.

There is no technical reason anymore why there is a separate faxlog
database! :)  As such, you may like to change the structure of this
table.  But please let me know if this is your intention.

The functionality desired is to enable Hostmasters to record new faxes
(domain(s) per fax) in the faxlog table.  This data should also be
searchable from within CRS.

At present it is just the very basic web form on our intranet.  Faxes
which are received by the modem on the faxserver are converted by the
fax server software into *.tif files.  From there we use cron to move
them to the apache dir which displays a list of the *.tif files.  The
hostmaster pastes a list of the domain(s) that the fax is to be
associated with, in to the basic web form.  This web form inserts the
records per domain into the faxlog db.

Again, there may be more than one domain listed per fax.  No you don't
just change the domain column, you create new rows per domain depending
on the type of fax (There is more than one type of fax (Paper, Tif &
email attachment)

one row per domain?

Yes, it's a mess!  date2 is not used (legacy).  You can consider "date"
as the actual field to use.

>
>
>
>
>

:) Yes, it is quite a mess.  But the data is still useful.

The field name can be changed.  The numerical values such as 0,5,6 & 7
are legacy values.  These can be updated to "Legacy".

The other values are useful for indicating what the purpose of a fax
is.  For example a fax may relate to a "New Reg" or another may relate
to a "Bill-C Transfer"

>
> 9.  can the LOG column has any other value?
Do you need to add values?

>
> 10.         what is the path to the fax files?

The Tif files are presently stored on the eFax server.
The faxes received by email attachment are stored on a shared network drive.
The hard copy fax files are obviously stored in a filing cabinet.


I know some of this information may be confusing, so if you would prefer
a conference call, please let me know.

Kind regards

Billy
